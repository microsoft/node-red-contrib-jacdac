# Node-RED Jacdac Node

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org) nodes to talk to [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac).

Jacdac is a bus-based plug-and-play hardware and software stack for microcontrollers and their peripherals. Jacdac is primarily designed for “modular electronics” scenarios that support rapid prototyping, creative exploration, making and learning through physical computing. Jacdac is designed to be cheap, flexible and extensible.

The nodes connect to a Jacdac bus via a USB and allow to listen for events or sensor readings.

## Install

Use Palette manager in node-red or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically ``~/.node-red``

    npm install node-red-contrib-jacdac

### !!Requirements!!

This node uses [node-usb](https://github.com/tessel/node-usb) which has specific installation requirements. If your node-red process crashes with 
``LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``, your USB setup is not right.

## Jacdac firmware

You will need to connect a device with Jacdac firmware and USB port. 
You can learn more about compatible hardware at https://aka.ms/jacdac.

If you have a micro:bit V2 at hand, you can convert it into a Jacdac device by dropping
custom firmware.

* go to https://makecode.microbit.org/beta
* create a new project
* click on the project settings, ``Extensions``
* search for https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-jacdac/devices/microbit and import it
* use the blocks under ``Servers`` to start which sensor you want
* download to your micro:bit V2
* enjoy data!

## Nodes

### jacdac-event

This node listens for [Jacdac events](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/reference/protocol#events) and send them in the payload. 
You can browse the [services specification catalog](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/) to discover which events are available.

### jacdac-report

This node reads [Jacdac registers](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/reference/protocol#registers) and send them in the payload. 
You can browse the [services specification catalog](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/) to discover which registers are avilable are available.

By default, the node looks for sensor reading, value and intensity registers. 
But you can override this behavior by customizing the register filters by name or code.

### jacdac-command

This node sends [Jacdac commands](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/reference/protocol/#commands)
to services. The results of command can be inferred from the content of the registers.

You can browse the [services specification catalog](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/services/) to discover which commands are available and how their payload should be formatted. The payload can either be a number, string or boolean for simple t
ypes. Or an array or JSON object for complex requests.
## Developer section
### Adding Nodes

You can quickly scaffold a new node and add it to the node set. Use the following command to create `my-new-node-type` node:

```
yarn add-node my-new-node-type
```

The node generator is based on mustache templates. At the moment there are three templates available:

- `blank` (used by default) - basic node for Node-RED >=1.0
- `blank-0` - node with a backward compatibility for running on Node-RED <1.0
- `config` - configuration node

To generate a node using a template, specify it as the third argument:

```
yarn add-node my-new-node-type blank
```

or

```
yarn add-node my-new-node-config config
```

### Developing Nodes

Build & Test in Watch mode:

```
yarn dev
```

### Building Node Set

Create a production build:

```
yarn build
```
